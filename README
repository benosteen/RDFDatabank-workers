RDFDatabank workers
===================

This provides a basic supervisor framework, which plugs into the queue of changes
within redis that are emitted from within the RDF Databank.

This apes the debian Apache2 configuration in which the supervisor.conf is split up
 between the general settings in supervisor.conf and the individual worker/process 
 settings in 'workers_{available|enabled}' - any .conf file in workers_enabled get 
 loaded by the supervisor process, and it is expected that configuration files
 will be symlinked from the workers_available directory into the enabled directory.
 
 There is a convenience configuration however, to save having to construct .conf
 files by hand or to manage which ones are live. Altering the configuration within
 'loglines.cfg' and then running 'create_supervisord_config.py' will create entries
 for each entry within loglines.cfg
 
 The basic configuration is fairly simple and consists of 5 conf files:

 process_redis.conf   - starts a redis process but should not be trusted to shutdown one without due care
 process_solr.conf    - starts a solr jetty instance
 worker_broker.conf   - starts a python script (included) that listens on one redis 'queue'
                        and redistributes copies to other queues as configured in 'loglines.cfg'
 worker_solr.conf     - Starts the worker that pushes documents to solr, by deconstructing the manifest.rdf
                        in each object and indexes the dcterms predicates to solr predicates (dcterms:{pred} -> solr doc: <field name="{pred}" ...)
 logger_auditlogger.conf - logs all the messages it recieves to disc
